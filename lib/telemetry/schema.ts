/**
 * The client error telemetry contract.
 *
 * Operational diagnostics are only useful if they preserve user privacy and
 * stay stable enough to correlate an incident across reports. This module is
 * the single definition of what a client error event may contain — the
 * allow-list, the stable category vocabulary, and nothing else.
 *
 * The rule this contract is built on: **fields are allow-listed, never
 * denied.** A deny-list has to anticipate every future leak; an allow-list
 * only has to be reviewed when someone wants to add a field. Everything a
 * browser error naturally carries — the message, the stack, the URL, the
 * DOM — is therefore absent unless it appears below.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded, and why:
 *
 * - **Wallet addresses / credentials / proof bodies / payment data** — never
 *   collected at any layer. `lib/telemetry/redact.ts` additionally scrubs
 *   them out of anything derived from an error message, so a leak needs two
 *   independent mistakes rather than one.
 * - **Full URLs and query strings** — `/verify?proof=EP-8A42-91DC` is how
 *   proof IDs travel through this app. Only a low-cardinality route pattern
 *   from `lib/diagnostics/sanitize.ts` is reported.
 * - **Raw error messages and stacks** — messages routinely embed the value
 *   that caused the failure (a pasted credential, a proof ID, an API URL).
 *   Only a redacted, length-capped *shape* of the message is sent.
 * - **User, session, or wallet identifiers of any kind** — see
 *   `lib/telemetry/correlation.ts` for what the correlation id is and, more
 *   importantly, what it is not.
