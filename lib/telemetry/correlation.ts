/**
 * Correlation identifiers for client error telemetry.
 *
 * What these identifiers ARE: opaque random values that let an on-call
 * responder group the errors of a single page load, and let a user quote one
 * id in a support request.
 *
 * What they are explicitly NOT, and the properties that keep them that way:
 *
 * - **Not derived from anything.** They are generated from a CSPRNG with no
 *   input. They cannot be computed from a wallet address, an account, a
 *   proof, or a device, so they reveal nothing about who produced them and
 *   two users' ids can never collide meaningfully.
 * - **Not an authenticator.** Nothing in this app accepts a correlation id
 *   as a credential; it grants no access and is never sent in an
 *   `Authorization` header. It is safe to print in a log or paste into a
 *   support ticket precisely because holding one proves nothing.
 * - **Not persistent.** The page-load id lives in a module-scoped variable
 *   and dies with the document. It is never written to `localStorage`,
 *   `sessionStorage`, a cookie, or an URL, so it cannot become a
 *   cross-session tracking identifier.
