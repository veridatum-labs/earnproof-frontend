/**
 * Sampling boundaries for client error telemetry.
 *
 * Sampling exists to bound cost and volume, not to hide failures, so the
 * rules are deliberately blunt and fail *closed*:
 *
 * - A rate of `0` never samples; a rate of `1` always samples.
 * - Anything that is not a finite number in `[0, 1]` — `NaN`, a negative
 *   rate, a rate above 1, a string from a misconfigured env var — is treated
 *   as `0`. A misconfiguration silently disables reporting rather than
 *   silently flooding a collector with user-triggered events.
 * - The boundary is `random < rate`, so `rate = 0` can never sample (the
 *   smallest possible random value is 0) and `rate = 1` always does.
