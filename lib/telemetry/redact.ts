/**
 * Redaction for client error telemetry.
 *
 * A browser error message is the single most likely place for user data to
 * escape: it routinely embeds the value that caused the failure. In this app
 * that value can be a Stellar address, a pasted verifiable credential, a
 * proof ID, a bearer token, or an API URL with a query string.
 *
 * `redactMessage` therefore does not try to decide whether a message is
 * safe. It rewrites every recognizable *shape* of sensitive data into a
 * placeholder token, drops anything URL-like wholesale, and caps the result.
 * What survives is enough to tell two different failures apart ("Failed to
 * fetch", "Unexpected token < in JSON") and nothing more.

 *
 * Order matters twice over: broad structural shapes (key material, JSON
 * payloads, URLs) are consumed before the narrower value shapes, and the
 * narrow shapes run before the generic long-token rules so a Stellar address
 * is not partially eaten by them.
 *
 * Placeholders are angle-bracketed (`<address>`) rather than
 * square-bracketed on purpose: a later rule must never be able to match a
 * placeholder an earlier rule produced, and `[...]` is exactly what the
 * JSON-payload rule looks for.
