/**
 * Privacy-safe normalization for Web Vitals / diagnostics reporting.
 *
 * These helpers strip anything that could identify a person, a wallet, or a
 * specific credential/proof before a metric is logged or sent anywhere:
 *
 * - Query strings are dropped entirely. `/verify?proof=EP-8A42-91DC` and
 *   similar URLs are how proof IDs travel through this app, and query
 *   strings are unbounded/high-cardinality by nature, so the safest rule is
 *   "never forward them", not "try to allow-list the safe ones".
 * - The path itself is matched against a fixed list of known route
 *   patterns. Anything that doesn't match a known static route collapses to
 *   "/other" rather than being reported verbatim — this guards against
 *   future dynamic segments (e.g. a `/verify/[proofId]` route) leaking a
 *   proof ID or wallet address through the path.
