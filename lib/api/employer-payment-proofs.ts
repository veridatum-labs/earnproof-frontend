/**
 * Employer-payment proof: a minimal-disclosure proof that a worker
 * received payment(s) from a specific, eligible employer source within a
 * bounded period — WITHOUT disclosing exact transaction amounts. This is
 * intentionally distinct from the existing payment-receipt proof
 * (`lib/api/payment-receipt-proofs.ts`), which proves receipt of one
 * specific payment and lets the worker opt into disclosing its exact
 * amount. This wizard has no amount field in its request shape at all —
 * there is no way to opt into amount disclosure, by design (see
 * `CreateEmployerPaymentProofRequest` below).
 *
 * NOTE: `/proofs/employer-payment` is not yet defined in
 * `lib/api/openapi/earnproof-api.v1.json`. This module follows the same
 * request/response conventions as the sibling payment-receipt and
 * recurring-income proof clients (REST under `/proofs`, bearer auth,
 * `apiClient` + `retryMutation`) so it can be wired up with no shape
 * changes once the endpoint ships. Not registered in
 * `lib/api/client-contracts.json` since the schema isn't in the OpenAPI
 * spec yet.
 *
 * Employer source model: the current API has no organization- or
 * issuer-level wallet address (`Organization`/`Issuer` in the OpenAPI
 * spec carry no wallet field), so there is no server-verifiable link
 * between a payment's `sourceAddress` and a specific registered employer
 * today. Given that constraint, this module derives candidate "employer
 * sources" from the worker's own synced payments, grouped by
 * `sourceAddress`, using the existing payment classification/eligibility
 * fields as the trust signal:
 *  - eligible, INCOME-classified payments from a source -> a trusted,
 *    selectable source
 *  - EXCLUDED or ineligible payments from a source -> untrusted/revoked,
 *    never selectable
 * This is a deliberate frontend approximation pending a real
 * employer-registry endpoint; see the PR description for the full
 * rationale.
