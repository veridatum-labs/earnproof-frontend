 * Organization membership and role management.
 *
 * NOTE: `/organizations/{id}/members` is not yet defined in
 * `lib/api/openapi/earnproof-api.v1.json` — the backend does not expose
 * these endpoints today. This module follows the same request/response
 * conventions as the sibling `organizations.ts` / `issuers.ts` clients
 * (REST resource under `/organizations/{id}`, bearer auth, `apiClient`
 * retry helpers) so it can be wired up with no shape changes once the
 * endpoints ship. Because the schema isn't in the OpenAPI spec, it is
 * deliberately NOT registered in `lib/api/client-contracts.json` (that
 * file is checked against the real spec by `npm run test:contracts`).
 *
 * The UI built on top of this module (`components/organizations/
 * organization-members.tsx`) treats any request failure as "unavailable"
 * rather than silently showing an empty list, so users aren't told a
 * member-less organization when the real cause is a missing endpoint.
