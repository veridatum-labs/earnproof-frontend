/**
 * Whether `predecessor` can be renewed by the given caller (#168).
 *
 * - Revoked proofs can never be renewed (a revoked credential's claim is
 *   no longer trusted; renewing it would launder a bad claim into a fresh
 *   one).
 * - Only the proof's own owner (issuerId match against the caller's own
 *   issuer/session identity) may renew it — "compatible proof types and
 *   owners" from the issue's Scope.
 * - Only the same proof type may be renewed into itself (a MINIMUM_INCOME
 *   proof renews into another MINIMUM_INCOME proof, never into a
 *   PAYMENT_RECEIPT) — renewal is meant to extend an existing claim's
 *   validity period, not change what's being claimed.
 * - A proof that already has a successor is not eligible again (checked by
 *   the caller via findSuccessorOf before calling this, since that's
 *   session/store state, not a property of the proof itself).
