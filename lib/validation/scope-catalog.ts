/**
 * Grouped scope metadata for the API key creation form (#181).
 *
 * There is no scope-grouping or risk metadata in the API contract itself
 * (lib/api/openapi/earnproof-api.v1.json's ApiKey.scopes is a plain
 * `string[]`); AVAILABLE_SCOPES/SCOPE_DESCRIPTIONS in lib/api/keys.ts and
 * lib/validation/api-keys.ts are the only hand-authored source of truth for
 * what a scope is. This catalog is an additional, purely client-side layer
 * on top of that: it groups the same AVAILABLE_SCOPES by the resource they
 * govern and flags which ones are broad (can mutate/delete things outside
 * this API key's own data), so the review UI can warn on them. It derives
 * from AVAILABLE_SCOPES (never re-lists it by hand) so an unrecognized
 * scope fails closed rather than silently rendering as selectable - see
 * `scopeGroupFor`/`isKnownScope` below.
