 * "unauthorized or archived" is approximated here as "not selectable
 * unless ACTIVE or PENDING" - an org that's SUSPENDED, REVOKED (the
 * archive lifecycle action's target status), or DELETED can never be
 * switched into. This is disclosed as an approximation: a real
 * implementation would check the caller's actual membership list, which
 * this API does not expose.
