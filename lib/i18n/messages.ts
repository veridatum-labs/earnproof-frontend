/**
 * Message ownership.
 *
 * A user-facing string needs an owner: exactly one module that defines it,
 * one stable key that identifies it, and one place a translator will later
 * be handed. Strings written inline in JSX have none of those things — they
 * cannot be found, cannot be reviewed as a set, and cannot be replaced
 * without touching the component.
 *
 * `defineMessages` is the convention:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const messages = defineMessages("status", {
 *   title: "Platform status",
 *   lastChecked: "Last checked",
 * });
 *
 * <h1>{messages.title}</h1>
 * ```
 *
 * The namespace is the owner, the key is stable, and `messages.title` is a
 * whole string — never a fragment. When `NEXT_PUBLIC_PSEUDO_LOCALE=1`, every
 * value in the catalog comes back pseudo-localized, which is what makes an
 * un-owned inline string obvious on screen: it stays plain ASCII while
 * everything around it is accented and expanded.

 * code. With a placeholder the whole sentence stays one owned string and the
 * translation is free to move `{amount}` wherever its language needs it.
 *
 * A placeholder with no matching value is left in place rather than rendered
 * as `undefined`, so a missing value is visible instead of silently blank.
