 * Dedicated Playwright configuration for the accessibility suite
 * (e2e/accessibility): axe scans, keyboard interaction, and the zoom /
 * reflow / large-text regression checks.
 *
 * It is separate from playwright.config.ts (functional e2e) and
 * playwright.visual.config.ts (visual regression) for the same reason those
 * two are separate from each other: this suite runs one worker at a time so
 * focus- and layout-sensitive assertions are deterministic, and it points
 * the app at the mocked API origin the fixtures in
 * e2e/accessibility/fixtures intercept.
 *
 * This config previously lived as a second `defineConfig()` block inside
 * playwright.config.ts, which made that file a syntax error.
