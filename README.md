# EarnProof Frontend

EarnProof is an open-source, privacy-focused income and payment verification protocol built on Stellar.

This repository contains the Next.js web application for public education, proof verification, worker workflows, issuer workflows, admin workflows, and developer-facing setup pages.

## Product Positioning

EarnProof helps people prove financial facts without revealing more financial information than necessary.

Primary tagline:

```text
Prove your income, not your entire financial history.
```

The first implementation targets Stellar testnet and Freighter. The application should always make the active network visible and avoid implying that EarnProof provides credit decisions, legal identity verification, tax certification, or loan approval.

## Current Scope

Implemented:

- Next.js App Router application
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Public layout shell
- Responsive public navigation
- Footer
- Landing page
- How it works page
- Privacy page
- Developer page
- Verification page shell
- Issuer directory shell
- Status page shell
- Shared API client
- Public environment configuration

Planned next:

- Freighter wallet connection
- Wallet challenge authentication flow
- Worker dashboard
- Payment discovery and classification
- Proof creation wizard
- Public verification result view
- Proof revocation views

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- TanStack Query
- React Hook Form

## Local Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Default local URL:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

If port `3000` is already in use:

```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

## Environment Variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE=Test SDF Network ; September 2015
```

No secret keys belong in this frontend repository or any public environment variable.

## Validation

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Privacy and UX Requirements

- Show Stellar testnet status on relevant screens.
- Hide sensitive amounts by default.
- Show a disclosure preview before proof creation.
- Clearly distinguish valid, expired, revoked, invalid, and unverified issuer states.
- Do not expose full wallet history on verification pages.
- Do not put secret keys or signing material in client code.
- Keep public verification views limited to intentionally disclosed claim data.
