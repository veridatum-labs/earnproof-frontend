 * Next.js applies every matching rule and, when two rules set the same
 * header key for the same path, the *last* matching rule wins (see
 * node_modules/next/dist/docs/.../headers.md#header-overriding-behavior).
 * So this list is ordered least-specific first: the broad public-static
 * default comes first, then the health/verification/authenticated
 * overrides that must never be cached come after it, in that order, so
 * their `no-store` value always wins on the routes they target.
